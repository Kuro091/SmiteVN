# SmiteVN

## BACKEND's CONFIG FILE (Which host mongodbUri, smite's devkey) IS EDITED TO PREVENT ACCESS SO YOU NEED TO PROVIDE THOSE ON YOUR OWN

You need devkey and authkey from smite api. Ask them here https://webcdn.hirezstudios.com/hirez-studios/legal/smite-api-developer-guide.pdf
Set up mongodb to get a MongoDBUri

Edit them all in config.js file in the BackEnd to run.

FrontEnd should run fine though
